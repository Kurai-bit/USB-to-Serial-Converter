# USB to Serial Converter 

## Setup
Start a new branch with task name and nickname.
Use CH340G, CP2102, or FT232 IC.

## Goal: Build a USB-to-TTL serial converter PCB that interfaces a PC to microcontrollers.

## Tasks
Create a schematic including the USB IC, USB connector, required caps, and ESD protection.
Add TX/RX LEDs for activity monitoring (optional).
Route USB data lines with correct impedance spacing.
Include test pads or headers for TX, RX, GND, VCC.
Document the pinout and instructions for use.

## Submit: Schematic, PCB layout, BOM, Gerbers, and usage guide PDF.
## Estimated time: 2 weeks
